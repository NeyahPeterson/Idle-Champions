# MemoryFunctionsFullRead
## Description:
This AddOn will attempt to test ALL read/get functions contained in the `IC_MemoryFunctions_Class`. This only works for functions that have 0-1 parameters and if there is 1 parameter, 1 must be a valid value.

## Change Log:
v1.0.1, February 5, 2022
    This add on should now work correctly without Full Memory Read add on enabled.
